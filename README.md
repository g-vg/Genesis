# Genesis Virtual Grid (GVG)

**Genesis Virtual Grid** is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain protocol designed for the decentralized creative economy. It unifies deterministic execution, AI-native tooling, verifiable privacy, and tokenization infrastructure into a performant and modular chain.

Built from the ground up for creators, technologists, and institutions, Genesis reimagines what a purpose-built chain for art, intelligence, and ownership should look like.

## üîë Key Concepts

- **Truss-Based Execution**  
  Zero-fee, energy-based logic replaces gas with predictable and equitable interaction costs.

- **Genesis Virtual Grid (GVG)**  
  A smart contract engine compatible with EVM, but extended with native ZK support and secure AI model interfacing.

- **AI & ZK Infrastructure**  
  Secure, scalable off-chain inference verified via cryptographic proofs and zk-attested outputs.

- **Modular Privacy Architecture**  
  Selective visibility, DID-based compliance, and on-chain proof systems with no PII exposure.

- **Tokenization & Dynamic Assets**  
  Real-world assets tokenized with NFC anchors, and NFTs that evolve with user interaction and off-chain data.
