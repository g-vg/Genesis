# Genesis Virtual Grid (GVG)

**Genesis Virtual Grid** is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol purpose-built for the decentralized creative economy. It merges verifiable AI, tokenization of physical and digital assets, dynamic NFT infrastructure, and privacy-first architecture into a cohesive, scalable chain.

Genesis is engineered for creators, developers, and researchers who require more than general-purpose chains can offer — including deterministic execution, programmable privacy, and AI-native tooling.

## Vision

We believe that the next wave of cultural, creative, and financial systems will be powered by blockchains that are:

- **Energy-efficient and predictable** (no unpredictable gas fees)
- **Built for intelligent computation** (AI-inference with proof)
- **Privacy-aware and compliance-capable**
- **Rooted in artistic, cultural, and physical value**

Genesis is being developed to serve as this foundational infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

- **Truss Energy System**  
  A deterministic execution model that replaces gas with predictable energy credits.

- **Genesis Virtual Grid (GVG)**  
  A custom execution environment compatible with Ethereum's EVM, extended with ZK support and AI hooks.

- **AI Integration**  
  Native support for off-chain inference, proof of AI outputs, and on-chain interaction with generative systems.

- **On-Chain Privacy & Compliance**  
  Modular privacy options using zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable credentials, and regulatory interfacing without exposing PII.

- **Tokenization Infrastructure**  
  NFC/RFID anchoring, dynamic metadata, and evolving digital assets.

## Status

This repository will soon contain:

- Core protocol implementation
- Execution engine and runtime specifications
- Validator architecture and node setup
- Documentation and SDK for developers
- Tools for ZK and AI integration

---

## Goals

1. Launch a working DevNet with validator and observer node architecture.
2. Release Genesis SDK for developers.
3. Provide Truss-based execution testing and energy estimation.
4. Enable zk-proof integration and AI inference hooks.
5. Open governance framework and validator onboarding.
